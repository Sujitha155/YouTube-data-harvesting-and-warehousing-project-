## Background Rule using MongoDB and SQL:
- MongoDB and SQL databases can be used to implement background rules for data processing and management in applications.
- MongoDB, a NoSQL database, offers flexibility and scalability, making it suitable for storing unstructured or semi-structured data.
- SQL databases, on the other hand, provide strong consistency and support for complex querying, making them suitable for structured data and transactions.
- Background rules implemented using MongoDB or SQL could include tasks such as data validation, aggregation, indexing, and data cleaning processes.
- These rules can run asynchronously in the background to ensure data integrity, performance, and reliability.

## Streamlit:
- Streamlit is an open-source Python library used for building interactive web applications for data science and machine learning projects.
- It allows developers to create web-based user interfaces directly from Python scripts, without requiring knowledge of web development languages like HTML, CSS, or JavaScript.
- Streamlit provides various components and widgets for creating interactive elements such as sliders, buttons, text inputs, and plots.
- Users can interact with data, visualize results, and perform analyses in real-time using Streamlit applications.
- Streamlit applications can be easily deployed on various platforms, including local servers, cloud services, and containerized environments.
